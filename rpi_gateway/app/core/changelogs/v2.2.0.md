Priority: medium

Implemented intelligent retry logic for server connections to reduce unnecessary load and prevent request spam during outages.

### New
- Exponential backoff retry system (10s, 30s, 1min, 5min, up to 10min max delay)
- Intelligent connection state management with retry tracking
- Detailed logging for connection retry attempts and timing

### Improved
- Gateway respects retry intervals during persistent connection issues
- Reduced unnecessary server requests during network outages
- Better logging showing retry count and estimated next retry time
- Connection check logic optimized to prevent repeated failed attempts

### Fixed
- Excessive update requests to server on connection failures
- Server error spam from repeated failed requests
- Unnecessary load on server from devices making constant retry attempts
