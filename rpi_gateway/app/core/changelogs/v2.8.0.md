## v2.8.0 (2026-02-20)- Actuator Event Logging & Analytics
Priority: medium

Comprehensive actuator event logging system with real-time Firebase synchronization and mobile app analytics integration.

### New
- Firebase actuator event logging (`actuator_logs/{device_id}/{timestamp}`)
- Automatic mode detection (automation vs manual control)
- Historical actuator state tracking with timestamps
- Room-specific actuator event attribution
- Analytics data source for mobile app

### Improved
- Firebase sync now includes both sensor data and actuator events
- Actuator state changes logged in real-time with mode context
- Enhanced automation logging with granular event tracking

### Fixed
- Actuator state sync consistency across Firebase and local storage

### Changed
- All actuator state changes (auto and manual) now create timestamped log entries
- Firebase structure updated: `actuator_logs/{device_id}/{timestamp_key}`
- Log entry format: `{room, actuator, state, mode, timestamp, timestamp_unix}`

### Known Limitations
- AI decision logs not yet implemented in Firebase (coming in v2.9.0)
- Actuator usage statistics require additional aggregation queries
