## v2.5.0 (2026-02-11) - Stateful Alerts & Notifications
Priority: medium

Implemented a robust, stateful alert system that tracks active issues and allows user acknowledgement.

### New
- **Stateful Alert System**: Alerts are now tracked in the database as "Active" until the condition is resolved.
- **Alert Acknowledgement**: Users can now acknowledge alerts to mark them as seen.
- **Active Alerts Dashboard**: New section in the Alerts page showing real-time active issues.
- **History Tracking**: All alerts (active and resolved) are logged to history.

### Improved
- **Alert Logic**: Logic engine now automatically resolves alerts when sensor readings return to normal.
- **Database Schema**: Added `active_alerts` table with indices for performance.
- **Git Ignoring**: Added `*.db` to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental database commits.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where alerts were stateless and flooded the logs repeatedly.
