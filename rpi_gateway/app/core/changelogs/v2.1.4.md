## v2.1.4 (2026-02-10) - Configuration Management Improvements
Priority: low

Improved configuration management with automatic version tracking and environment variable support.

### New
- Automatic firmware version injection (no manual version updates needed)
- Environment variable support that overrides configuration file settings
- Device UUID support for backend API authentication
- Clear documentation distinguishing device ID vs serial number usage

### Improved
- Configuration loading now properly respects environment variable overrides
- Firmware version always stays in sync automatically
- Better separation of identifiers: UUID for backend, serial number for display
