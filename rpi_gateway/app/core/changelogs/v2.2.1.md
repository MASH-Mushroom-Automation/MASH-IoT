## v2.2.1 (2026-02-11) - Heartbeat Stability
Priority: medium

Fixed excessive server requests and improved automatic recovery when Arduino reconnects after a timeout.

### Fixed
- Resolved issue where the gateway sent redundant data updates to the server every 5 seconds
- Fixed connection retry logic that prevented proper backoff during server failures
- Arduino now automatically recovers when serial communication resumes after a timeout
- Reduced watchdog timeout from 10 minutes to 60 seconds for faster issue detection

### New
- Arduino sends a recovery signal when it resumes after a timeout
- Gateway detects recovery signal and automatically restores actuator states
- Safety system now tracks recovery count and downtime duration
