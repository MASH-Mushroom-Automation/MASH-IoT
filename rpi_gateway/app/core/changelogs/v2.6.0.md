## v2.6.0 (2026-02-17) - QR Code Device Pairing
Priority: medium

Zero-configuration device pairing via QR code scanning. Mobile users can now instantly connect to IoT devices by scanning a QR code displayed on the Raspberry Pi touchscreen dashboard.

### New
- QR code generation function for device connection pairing
- Dashboard floating action button showing connection QR code
- QR modal popup with device ID and IP address display
- Mobile app instant connection via QR scan (no manual IP entry required)
- Base64 PNG QR encoding with JSON device metadata

### Improved
- Device connection workflow now takes ~5 seconds (vs 30-60s network scan)
- Zero-configuration setup reduces user errors from manual IP typing
- Visual QR display optimized for 1024x600 touchscreen readability

### Changed
- Added /api/connection-qr endpoint returning QR image as data URL
- Dashboard UI now includes floating QR button in bottom-right corner
- QR contains JSON: device type, device ID, device name, IP address, port

### Known Limitations
- QR codes do not expire (security consideration for future enhancement)
- Plain JSON encoding (no encryption - suitable for local network only)
- Requires camera permission on mobile device for QR scanning
