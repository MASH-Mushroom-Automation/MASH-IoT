## v2.4.0 (2026-02-11) - Multi-Device Sync & OTA UI
Priority: medium

This release introduces multi-device support for cloud synchronization and adds a user-friendly update checker to the Settings page.

### New
- Added "Check for Updates" button in Settings -> About System.
- Added update status badge (Up to Date, Update Available, Critical).
- Added "Update Available" modal with changelog preview and "Update Now" action.

### Improved
- **Firebase Sync**: Sensor data is now nested under the unique device serial number, preventing data collisions when multiple gateways are active on the same project.
- **Settings UI**: The settings content area now scrolls independently of the sidebar for better usability on smaller screens.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where sensor data from different devices could overwrite each other in the cloud database.
