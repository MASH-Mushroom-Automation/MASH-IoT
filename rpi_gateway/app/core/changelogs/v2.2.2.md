## v2.2.2 (2026-02-11) - I2C Recovery
Priority: high

Fixed root cause of Arduino sensor stoppage: I2C bus lockup that froze the system after approximately 4 minutes of operation.

### Fixed
- Resolved Arduino sensor data freeze caused by I2C bus becoming unresponsive
- Sensor readings no longer hang indefinitely when the I2C communication line locks up
- Gateway now detects when Arduino stops sending data and automatically recovers

### New
- Hardware watchdog timer with 8-second timeout for automatic crash recovery
- I2C communication timeout (3 seconds) prevents the system from freezing
- I2C bus recovery mechanism that resets the communication line when stuck
- Gateway warns after 30 seconds of missing data and resets connection after 60 seconds
- Gateway detects Arduino reboots and automatically restores actuator states

### Changed
- Safety system simplified to monitoring-only (crash recovery handled by hardware watchdog)
